# System Specification: Smart Appointment Scheduling System

## Project Title:
Smart Appointment Scheduling System

## Domain:
Healthcare

## Problem Statement:
The current method of scheduling appointments in many healthcare systems is inefficient and prone to errors. This leads to missed appointments, scheduling conflicts, and wasted time. The systemâ€™s purpose is to automate the appointment booking and management process, improving both patient and healthcare provider experiences.

## Individual Scope:
This system will allow patients to book, manage, and cancel appointments with healthcare providers. Healthcare providers will be able to view, manage, and optimize their schedules. The system will integrate with a database for storing appointment data and will also include a notification system for sending reminders.

### Feasibility Justification:
- The system will be developed using modern web technologies and will be implemented as a cloud-based solution.
- The technical feasibility is supported by widely available technologies such as web frameworks (React for frontend, Node.js for backend), and a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- The system's potential impact includes increased efficiency, improved access to healthcare services, and reduced administrative burden on healthcare providers.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should be able to handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
2. Response time for user requests should not exceed 2 seconds.
3. The system must be available 99.9% of the time.

## User Stories
