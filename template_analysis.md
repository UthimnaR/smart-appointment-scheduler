## ðŸŽ¯ **Chosen Template: Automated Kanban**
I selected the **Automated Kanban** template because:
1. It supports **sprint tracking** with built-in automation.
2. Issues **auto-move** between columns when their status changes.
3. It aligns with **Agile methodologies**, making task tracking easier.
4. The **Smart Appointment Scheduling System** requires structured workflows to track UI, API, and deployment tasks efficiently.

By using **Automated Kanban**, our team can **focus on development** while the system **automatically tracks progress**.
