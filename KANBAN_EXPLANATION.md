# Kanban Board Explanation  

## 📌 What is a Kanban Board?  
A **Kanban board** is a visual project management tool that helps track workflow stages, limit work-in-progress, and enhance collaboration. It supports Agile principles by allowing continuous delivery and iterative improvements.

## 🏗️ Our Kanban Board Structure  
Our **GitHub Kanban board** consists of the following columns:  
- **Backlog** – Tasks that are planned but not ready for work.  
- **Ready** – Tasks that are prioritized and ready to be picked up.  
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **In Review** – Tasks under review/testing before completion.  
- **Done** – Completed tasks.  

## 🏷️ Task Categorization and Labels  
Each task is labeled based on its type and priority:  
- `feature` – New functionality (e.g., *"Book an Appointment Online"*).  
- `enhancement` – Improvements to existing features (e.g., *"Modify Appointments as a Receptionist"*).  
- `bug` – Fixing critical issues (e.g., *"Prevent Double Booking"*).  
- `security` – Tasks related to system security (e.g., *"Encrypt User Data"*).  
- `must-have` – Critical tasks necessary for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  
- `won't have in current sprint` – Features planned for future iterations.  

## 📊 How the Board Supports Agile Principles  
1. **Workflow Visualization** – Tasks move from *Backlog* → *Ready* → *In Progress* → *In Review* → *Done*.  
2. **Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits** – Prevents overloading developers by limiting active tasks in *In Progress*.  
3. **Continuous Delivery** – Ensures an iterative approach, allowing completed features to be deployed faster.  
4. **Improved Collaboration** – Team members can assign tasks using `@mentions` and track progress through statuses.  

By structuring our Kanban board with **customized columns and task labels**, we ensure efficient project tracking and workflow transparency.
