Smart Appointment Scheduling System
Domain:
The domain for this project is the Healthcare Industry. Specifically, it focuses on optimizing the scheduling process for healthcare providers (doctors, clinics, hospitals) and their patients. The aim is to streamline appointment booking, reduce waiting times, and provide a more efficient scheduling experience for both patients and healthcare staff. This solution will improve the management of healthcare resources and enhance patient care by ensuring better availability and time utilization for healthcare professionals.

Problem Statement:
In many healthcare environments, the appointment booking process is inefficient, leading to long wait times for patients and underutilization of healthcare professionals' time. The lack of a reliable and automated scheduling system results in missed appointments, overbookings, and administrative overhead. The purpose of this system is to address these issues by allowing patients to book and manage appointments online while enabling doctors and administrators to better optimize their schedules.

Individual Scope:
The system aims to provide a comprehensive solution for scheduling and managing appointments in a healthcare setting. The scope of the project includes:

Patient Interface: A user-friendly web application where patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments with healthcare professionals.
Doctor/Admin Dashboard: An interface for doctors and administrators to manage appointments, view patient details, and optimize their schedules.
Database Management: A backend database to store user profiles, appointment data, and scheduling preferences.
Notification System: Automated reminders for patients and healthcare professionals about upcoming appointments.
