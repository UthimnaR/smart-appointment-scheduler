# Branch Protection Rules

## Why We Use Them

Branch protection rules help maintain code quality and stability by:
- Preventing buggy or untested code from being merged into `main`.
- Ensuring all changes go through code reviews (PRs).
- Forcing automated tests to pass before merging.
- Disabling direct pushes to encourage collaboration.

These rules are crucial for teams to:
- Catch errors early.
- Maintain clean history.
- Automate testing and deployment workflows.

They help ensure that `main` always stays deployable.
