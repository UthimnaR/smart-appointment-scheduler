⚙️ How the CI/CD Pipeline Works
✅ Continuous Integration (CI)
Every push or pull request triggers the CI workflow.

The CI pipeline sets up Java and runs all unit & integration tests.

If any test fails, the PR cannot be merged into main.

🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)
When a PR is merged into main:

The project is built using Maven/Gradle.

A JAR file (release artifact) is created and uploaded in GitHub Actions.

This ensures every release from main is automatically built and versioned.

🔐 Branch Protection
The main branch is protected with the following rules:

Requires at least 1 pull request review

No direct pushes allowed

CI checks must pass before merging
