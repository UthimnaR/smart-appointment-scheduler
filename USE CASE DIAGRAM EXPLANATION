## 🏗️ Diagram Design Approach  

### ✅ Actor-Use Case Association  
- **Patients** primarily interact with appointment booking and notifications.  
- **Receptionists** manage appointments but do not approve them.  
- **Doctors** only manage their schedules and do not alter appointments directly.  
- **Admins** oversee the entire system but do not directly handle bookings.  

### 🔄 Inclusion & Generalization Relationships  
- **"Cancel Appointment"** is a specialized form of **"Book Appointment"** since it alters the schedule.  
- **"Receive Notification"** is an included use case in both booking and cancellation processes.  

### 🔍 Stakeholder Considerations  
- The system **minimizes manual errors** by automating scheduling, notifications, and approvals.  
- **Patients and doctors have self-service options** to reduce administrative workload.  
- **Admin oversight ensures data accuracy and decision-making efficiency.**
